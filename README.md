# Barry-cox-momentum-factor-

In my Quantitative Finance Final project, I was asked to create a basket of stocks for long and short portfolio. We were asked to use Berry Cox list of alpha factor to determine the buy/short pick for the portfolio. My project focused on the Price Momentum factor of the Berry COX list of alpha factor. The price momentum factor consist of 
- Slope of 52 weeks trend line (20 day Lag) 
- percent above 260 days low (20 day Lag) 
- 4/52 weeks price oscillator  (20 days lag) 
- 39 week returns (20 days lag)
- 51 week volume price trend (20 day lag) 

In order to test the codes and asset selection legitimacy, back test was performed to validate the performance of my algorithms based on monthly restructuring since JAN 2016. 

In addition to that basket data was used to plot: 
- total return of basket since 2016 -2021
- Plotting relative monthly return
- plotting cumulative portfolio value over the year
- Plotting long and short basket return
